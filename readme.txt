A high-performance link checker for WordPress with affiliate detection, redirect chain analysis, and background processing.

== Description ==

**Muri Link Tracker** is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to help site owners maintain their SEO health and user experience by identifying broken links, analyzing redirect chains, and detecting affiliate patterns — all without slowing down your site.

Whether your site has 100 or 100,000 links, Muri Link Tracker scans them in the background and gives you a real-time dashboard to act on what matters: broken URLs, redirect loops, and missing rel attributes.

= Key Features =

* **Background Processing** — Scans run silently via Action Scheduler, so your admin stays responsive and your front-end stays fast.
* **Three Scan Modes** — Launch a **Full Scan** of all content, a **Delta Scan** (only posts modified since the last scan) to save resources, or a **Reset Data** to wipe and start fresh.
* **Live Progress Tracking** — Watch the scan progress in real time with a progress bar, counters, and the ability to cancel mid-scan.
* **Affiliate Link Detection** — Automatically identifies affiliate links across 14+ networks (Amazon, Awin, CJ, ShareASale, Impact, Rakuten, ClickBank, PartnerStack, and more), including **cloaked internal redirects** (internal URLs that redirect to external affiliates).
* **Redirect Chain Analysis** — Classifies every redirect as a **single hop**, a **chain of 2+ hops**, or a **loop**, so you know exactly what to fix first.
* **Affiliate Networks Breakdown** — See at a glance how many links belong to each affiliate program (Amazon, CJ, Awin…).
* **Modern React Dashboard** — Real-time statistics, quick filter tabs (All / Broken / Redirects / OK / Pending), inline editing, and bulk actions in a polished admin interface built with the WordPress design system.
* **Smart Filtering & Search** — Filter by status, link type, or affiliate network, and search across URLs and anchor text instantly.
* **CSV Export** — Export your full link inventory with active filters applied, perfect for reporting and auditing.
* **Silent Link Editing** — Fix or remove a link directly from the dashboard without bumping the post's modified date or creating revision clutter.
* **Configurable to Any Host** — Adjustable batch sizes, timeouts, request delays, and recheck intervals to fit shared hosting or dedicated servers.
* **Scan Resume** — Interrupted scans pick up exactly where they left off.
* **Gutenberg-Aware** — Extracts links from Gutenberg blocks with block-level metadata, including button blocks and navigation links.

= What It Detects =

* Broken links (4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes)
* Redirect chains and loops (single hop, multi-hop, infinite loops)
* Affiliate links via domain patterns, URL paths, query parameters, and `rel="sponsored"`
* Cloaked affiliate links (internal URLs that redirect to external affiliates)
* Missing rel attributes (nofollow, sponsored, ugc)
* Timeout and SSL/connection errors
* Both internal and external links, categorized automatically

= Privacy =

Muri Link Tracker makes outbound HTTP requests to verify the status of links found in your content. These requests use a clearly identified User-Agent string (`MuriLinkTracker/1.0.0`). No personal user data is collected, stored, or transmitted to third parties.

= Development =

The full source code, including React/JavaScript source files and build configuration, is available on GitHub:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the scanning work? =

Muri Link Tracker uses WordPress Action Scheduler to process scans in the background. Posts are scanned in configurable batches, and each link is verified via HTTP HEAD request with GET fallback. This ensures your site remains responsive during scans, even on shared hosting.

= What's the difference between Full Scan and Delta Scan? =

**Full Scan** re-indexes every link on your site and re-checks each URL's HTTP status. **Delta Scan** only processes posts modified since the last successful scan — ideal for recurring maintenance on large sites. Use Full Scan after major content migrations, Delta Scan for weekly check-ups.

= Does it slow down my site? =

No. All scanning and link checking happens in background processes via Action Scheduler. The plugin also includes configurable request delays and batch sizes to prevent overloading your server, and it automatically adapts batch size to available memory.

= What affiliate networks does it detect? =

Amazon, ShareASale, Commission Junction (CJ), Impact, Rakuten, ClickBank, Awin, Tradedoubler, Webgains, Commission Factory, FlexOffers, Skimlinks, Sovrn/VigLink, and PartnerStack. You can extend detection patterns via the `mltr/classifier/affiliate_patterns` filter.

= Can I detect cloaked affiliate links? =

Yes. When an internal URL (e.g., `/go/product-name`) redirects to an external affiliate, Muri Link Tracker flags it as **Cloaked** so you can audit your entire affiliate footprint, even when it's hidden behind pretty URLs.

= Can I scan only specific post types? =

Yes. In Settings, enter a comma-separated list of post types (e.g., `post, page, product`) to include in scans. Any custom post type is supported.

= What happens when I delete or edit a link? =

When you edit or delete a link through the plugin, it updates the `<a>` tag directly in the post content. The post's `modified_date` is **not** updated and no revision is created, so your SEO timestamps and revision history stay clean. Remember to purge your page cache after bulk edits if you use a caching plugin.

= Can I cancel a scan that's already running? =

Yes. A **Cancel Scan** button appears next to the progress bar during any active scan. Partial results are preserved.

= Can I resume an interrupted scan? =

Yes. If a scan is cancelled, crashes, or is interrupted by a server restart, you can resume it from the dashboard. The plugin tracks scan progress and picks up right where it left off.

= How often are links re-checked? =

You can configure a **Recheck Interval** (in days) from the Settings panel. Default is 7 days. Links past that threshold are automatically re-verified on the next Delta or Full Scan.

= Is the plugin translation-ready? =

Yes. All user-facing strings are internationalized and the text domain is `muri-link-tracker`. A POT file ships in `/languages/` for community translations.

== Screenshots ==

1. **Complete SEO Overview** — After a scan, the Dashboard shows the full picture at a glance: total links, OK/redirects/broken/errors counts, internal vs external vs affiliate vs cloaked breakdown, and a per-network affiliate tally (Amazon, CJ, Awin…).
2. **Start in Seconds** — A clean Dashboard greets you with three clear actions: Full Scan, Delta Scan, or Reset Data. Delta Scan saves time on large sites by only checking posts modified since your last scan.
3. **Focus on What's Broken** — The Broken filter surfaces every dead link (404, 410, DNS errors) in one view, ready for bulk fix or deletion. Silent editing keeps your post modified dates untouched.
4. **Track Every Redirect** — The Redirects filter lists every link that forwards through one or more hops, so you can update them to their final destinations and preserve link equity.
5. **Every Link at a Glance** — The link inventory mixes OK, broken, redirected, and errored URLs in a single sortable table, color-coded by status for instant triage.
6. **Real-Time Scan Progress** — Watch scans unfold live: progress bar, item counters, and summary stats update in real time. Cancel at any moment — partial results are preserved and the scan can be resumed later.
7. **Fine-Tune to Your Hosting** — The Settings panel lets you define which post types to scan, adjust batch size, set HTTP request timeouts and delays, and configure the automatic recheck interval to match any hosting environment.
